                <p>Starting as a local Indonesian clothing store in 2002, Budi Wijianto the CEO of M&T, succeeded in
                    establishing the biggest multinational clothing company. M&T started as a formal clothing store. His
                    first
                    store in Jakarta wasn't as big as his rival stores. Since 2004, he started selling clothes for
                    youngsters.
                    Thanks to his breakthrough idea, he became well known all over Indonesia.</p>
